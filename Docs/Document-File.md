# Ballerina
The Ballerina programming language is a modern and simple computer programming language.
- **Purpose:**
    - **General:** \
    Ballerina 1.0 is the first language based on the concept that modern application programming involves creating and using APIs. This open source language contributes to a complete simplification of the way developers build and deploy cloud-native distributed applications and services. \
    This is a multipurpose or general purpose programming language, which means that the programmer can use the Ballerina programming language to develop different types of applications, programs, software, etc.
    
    - **Specific:** \
    Unlike other programming languages, Ballerina has always been specifically conceived to enhance integration, which means that it is able to handle from the simplest to the most complex programs, such as complex service chaining and content-based routing scenarios. .

- **Paradigm:**
    The Ballerina programming language uses concurrent and non-blocking paradigms. \
    Ballerina is data oriented and NOT object oriented
    
- **Strengths and weaknesses**
   - **Strengths**
     1. Simplifies the way a program talks over the network, usually to an API. Its inventors claim that it is one of the first programming languages ​​to use modified syntax to achieve this feat.
     2. Ballerina is a modern and simple computer programming language.
     3. It is a free and open source programming language.
     4. Provides syntax reliability and maintainability function.
     5. Support concurrency function.
     6. Cross-platform or platform-independent programming language.
     7. Statically typed computer programming language.
   - **Weaknesses**
     1. One downside is that it is open source and focuses on growth rather than a stable language. This can be a disadvantage because as a programmer there is now a learning curve associated with your program. If you're a programmer working with ballerina, you have to keep up with what's changing as you code, which only serves to complicate a project. This added complexity and educational demand can potentially discourage larger corporations from using the language, as it costs time and money to educate programmers.

-**Implementation:**
   Ballerina is a compiled language: the compiler transforms the source code into Ballerina bytecode, which is a compact, optimized representation of the Ballerina source interpreted by a bytecode interpreter.
   
- **Runtime / Virtual Machine**
  - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) interpreter
  - Linked AST interpreter
  - Ballerina runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it fully interoperable with Java. We can easily access Java APIs from Ballerina.
  
- **Supported platforms:**
The Ballerina programming language is a cross-platform or platform-independent programming language, which means that programmers can run it on different operating systems such as:
    - windows
    - Linux
    - Unix
    - macOS
    - Etc.
    
- **Notable users:**
The Ballerina language is based on a visual representation so that everyone can use and understand it. Sequence diagrams are built as the code is created and a minimum of knowledge is required for its use, unlike other languages ​​that can only be used by experts.

- **History:** \
The development of the Ballerina programming language started in the year 2015 and in 2017, the Ballerina programming language appeared publicly. The Ballerina programming language was developed as an open source programming language and licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Version 1.0 of the Ballerina programming language was publicly released on September 10, 2019.

  - **Creators**
     The Ballerina programming language was:
     - **Designed by** Hasitha Aravinda, Sanjiva Weerawarana, Sameera Jayasoma, Frank Leymann, James Clark, Srinath Perera and WSO2.
     - **Developer** by WSO2.
     
  - **1st Release (version and date):**
     - (2019R1) 2019-05-01 First version with a new version scheme with significant revisions
     - (2019R2) 2019-07-01 Major language revision
     - **->** (2019R3) 2019-09-07 Ballerina 1.0 released in September 2019...Stable version used as a base for the jBallerina 1.0.0 implementation. Mostly a cleanup of 2019R2
     
  - **Last release (version and date):** (2022R1) 2022-01-31 First version of 2022. This is the base of Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake). (Current)
  
- **Status:** Active
